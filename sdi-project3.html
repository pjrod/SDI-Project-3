<p>My theme is about the human race and how they developed the ability to travel the stars.  With this they developed spaceships to travel.  While exploring they found many races and planet systems.  Some of these planet systems though had pirate spaceships that would prevent the faster exploration of more systems.  I chose this theme because I am a fan of space stories like Star Wars or Star Trek.  The theme also made it easier for me to code since I just made up everything as I went along.</p>
